1. Quick Installation

  Quick installation is only avaliable for unix systems. Windows users must follow the manual installation instructions in Section 2
  For easy installation there you can use the script
  ./setup.sh
  This will attempt to install python, setuptools and virtualenv through your distributions package manager if they are not present.
  blast+ is downloaded and installed into bin/ if they are not present on your system

  The system is installed into a virtual environment in the current working directory.
  This will also install pyramid and a number of other dependancies into the virtual environment. No permissions are required for installing these packages

  Once installed you can run the server with
  ./run

2. Manual Installation

  The recommended method is to install into a virtual environment away from your system python, but it is possible to run from your system python
  
  Minimum requirements:

  PACKAGE    PACKAGE MANAGER NAME  ALTERNATE INSTALLATION
  python     python                http://python.org/download/
  setuptools python-setuptools     http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py

  Recommended packages

  PACKAGE    PACKAGE MANAGER NAME   ALTERNATE INSTALLATION
  virtualenv python-virtualenv      easy_install "virtualenv"
  blast+                            ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST

  2.1 Setting up with a virtual environment
    Install virtualenv with either your package manager, or the easy_install script, then from the root directory of protvis run
    virtualenv --no-site-packages env
    cd env
    bin/easy_install pyramid
    #now run the server
    cd ..
    ./run

  2.2 Installing into your system python
    easy_install pyramid
    #now run the server
    ./Server.py

  2.3 Installing blast+ (Optional)
    blast+ allows protvis to generate coverage graphs for peptides in a protein

    If blast+ is already installed on your system you need to make links to it in the bin/ directory
    ln -s `which makeblastdb` bin/makeblastdb
    ln -s `which blastdbcmd` bin/blastdbcmd

    If you don't have blast+ and do not wish to install it into your system, you can download the latest version from
    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST and extract makeblastdb and blastdbcmd into bin/

    Restart the HTTP server once installed for changes to take effect

3. Development
  The script ./dojo_build is for recompiling the dojo library if you add additional dojo dependencies.
  This script requires either java or node. If neither is installed you will be given the option to install one of them in the script
