--== COMPILING ==--

Boost
  Boost does not need to be compiled. Only the headers for the preprocessor library are required.

zlib
  zlib will be compiled as part of the libpng compile process

libpng
  1. Open the visual studio project file under libpng\projects\visualc71\libpng.sln
     Even if you have visual studio 2010, still open this older project file as the filenames are broken in the new project file.
  2. Select "LIB Release" from the dropdown menu for project configuration in the toolbar
  3. Right click on the libpng project on the right hand side and select Build

Python
  1. Open the visual studio project file under Python\PCBuild\pcbuild.sln
  2. Select "Release" from the dropdown menu for project configuration in the toolbar
  3. Right click on the python project on the right hand side (highlighted in bold about half way down the list) and select Build

expat
  1. Open the visual studio project file under expat\lib\expat.dsp
  2. Select "Release" from the dropdown menu for project configuration in the toolbar
  3. Right click on the expat project on the right hand side and select Build
