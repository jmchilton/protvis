Description: ``pyramid_debugtoolbar``
        ========================
        
        ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` provides a debug toolbar useful while you're
        developing your Pyramid application.
        
        This code requires Pyramid 1.2a1 or better.
        
        Note that ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` is a blatant rip-off of Michael van
        Tellingen's ``flask-debugtoolbar`` (which itself was derived from Rob
        Hudson's ``django-debugtoolbar``).  It also includes a lightly sanded down
        version of the Werkzeug debugger code by Armin Ronacher and team.
        
        Demonstration
        -------------
        
        For a demonstration:
        
        - Create a virtualenv::
        
          $ virtualenv2.6 --no-site-packages env26
        
        - Clone the Pyramid trunk::
        
          $ git clone git@github.com:Pylons/pyramid.git
        
        - Install the Pyramid trunk into the virtualenv::
        
          $ cd pyramid
          $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop
        
        - Clone the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` trunk::
        
          $ git clone git@github.com:Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar.git
        
        - Install the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` trunk into the virtualenv::
        
          $ cd pyramid_debugtoolbar
          $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop
        
        - Install the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar/demo`` package into the virtualenv::
        
          $ cd demo
          $ $VENV/bin/python setup.py develop
        
        - Run the ``pyramid_debugtoolbar`` package's ``demo/demo.py`` file using the
          virtualenv's Python::
        
          $ $VENV/bin/python demo.py
        
        You will see a page full of test options to try when you visit
        ``http://localhost:8080``.
        
        
        0.9.5 (2011-11-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Adjust tox setup to test older Pyramid and WebOb branches under 2.5.
        
        - Convert all templates to Mako.
        
        - Don't rely on ``pyramid.compat.json``.
        
        - Add Tweens toolbar panel.
        
        0.9.4 (2011-09-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Upgrade to jquery 1.6.4 and tablesorter plugin 2.0.5b
        
        - Introduced new setting ``debugtoolbar.button_style``. Which can be used
          to override the default style (top:30px) set by ``toolbar.css``.
        
        - Compatible with Python 3.2 (requires Pyramid 1.3dev+).
        
        - Appease settings values that were sensitive to ``__getattr__`` in the
          settings debug panel (e.g. MongoDB databases).  See
          https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/30
        
        0.9.3 (2011-09-12)
        ------------------
        
        - All debug toolbar panels and underlying views are now always executable by
          entirely anonymous users, regardless of the default permission that may be
          in effect (use the ``NO_PERMISSION_REQUIRED`` permission for all
          debugtoolbar views).
        
        - Toolbar cookie settings name changed (from fldt to p_dt), to avoid messing
          up folks who use both the flask debugtoolbar and Pyramid's.
        
        - Fix IE7 and IE8 renderings of the toolbar.
        
        0.9.2 (2011-09-05)
        ------------------
        
        - Log an exception body to the debug toolbar logger when an exception
          happens.
        
        - Don't reset the root logger level to NOTSET in the logging panel (changes
          console logging output to sanity again).
        
        0.9.1 (2011-08-30)
        ------------------
        
        - The ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` setting is now a tri-state setting.  It
          can be one of ``debug``, ``display`` or ``false``.  ``debug`` means show
          the pretty traceback page with debugging controls.  ``display`` means show
          the pretty traceback package but omit the debugging controls.  ``false``
          means don't show the pretty traceback page.  For backwards compatibility
          purposes, ``true`` means ``debug``.
        
        - A URL is now logged to the console for each exception when
          ``debugtoolbar.intercept_exc`` is ``debug`` or ``display``.  This URL leads
          to a rendering of the "pretty" traceback page for an exception.  This is
          useful when the exception was caused by an AJAX or non-human-driven
          request.  This URL is also injected into the pretty traceback page (at the
          bottom).
        
        - "Unfixed" indentation of SQL EXPLAIN done in 0.9, it broke the explain page
          when a column value isn't a string.
        
        0.9 (2011-08-29)
        ----------------
        
        - Fixed indentation of SQL EXPLAIN by replacing spaces with HTML spaces.
        
        - ``response.charset`` in some undefined user-reported cases may be ``None``,
          which would lead to an exception when attempting to render the debug
          toolbar.  In such cases we now assume the charset is UTF-8.
        
        - Some renderings of the request vars and renderer values would raise an
          uncaught exception.
        
        0.8 (2011-08-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Try to cope with braindead Debian Python installs which package the
          ``pstats`` module separately from Python for god only knows what reason.
          Turn the performance panel off in this case instead of crashing.
        
        0.7 (2011-08-24)
        ----------------
        
        - Docs-only changes.
        
        0.6 (2011-08-21)
        ----------------
        
        - Do not register an alias when registering an implicit tween factory (compat
          with future 1.2 release).
        
        0.5 (2011-08-18)
        ----------------
        
        - The toolbar didn't work under Windows due to usage of the ``resource``
          module: https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/12
        
        0.4 (2011-08-18)
        ----------------
        
        - Change the default value for ``debugtoolbar.intercept_redirects`` to
          ``false.`` Rationale: it confuses people when first developing if the
          application they're working on has a home page which does a redirection.
        
        0.3 (2011-08-15)
        ----------------
        
        - Request vars panel would cause a UnicodeDecodeError under some
          circumstances (see https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid_debugtoolbar/issues/9).
        
        - Dynamicize URLs for SQLAlchemy subpanels.
        
        - Require "pyramid>=1.2dev" for install; the trunk is now "1.2dev" instead of
          "1.1.1dev".
        
        - Requires trunk after 2011-08-14: WSGIHTTPException "prepare" method and
          ``alias`` param to add_tween, BeforeRender event has no "_system" attr.
        
        - Fix memory leak.
        
        - HTML HTTP exceptions now are rendered with the debug toolbar div.
        
        - Added NotFound page to demo app and selenium tests.
        
        0.2 (2011-08-07)
        ----------------
        
        - Add SQLAlchemy "explain" and "select" pages (available from the SQLALchemy
          panel next to each query shown in the page).
        
        - Requires newer Pyramid trunk (checked out on 2011-08-07 or later).
        
        - Add a link to the SQLAlchemy demo page from the demo app index page.
        
        0.1 (2011-07-30)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
